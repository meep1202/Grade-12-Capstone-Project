# Capstone Project
## Background
Video game creation has always been a passion for me and I was able to fully delve into this process during the creation of my grade 12 capstone project at Pacific Christian School.

I used a video game maker called Construct 3 for both pixel art and game mechanics.

Note: In order to run the program you will need to launch Construct 3 in your browser.
