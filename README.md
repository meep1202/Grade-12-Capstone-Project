# Capstone Project
## Background
Video game creation has always been a passion for me and I was able to fully delve into this process during the creation of my grade 12 capstone project at Pacific Christian School.

I used a video game maker called Construct 3 for both pixel art and game mechanics.

This is a metroidvania platformer game revolving around the concept of using instruments as magical elemental weapons. It includes 20 different instruments, all with different sprites, attack animations, and projectiles. It also features various movement abilities, such as the double jump or flame dash. Currently there are two bosses and two additional enemy types. There are 3 levels, each with their own unique challenges, tilesets, and rewards.

Note: In order to run the program you will need to launch Construct 3 in your browser and upload the Capstone Project.C3P file.
